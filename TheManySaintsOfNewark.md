Movie: The Many Saints of Newark

Review: This prequel movie is billed as 'a Sopranos story' and it is exactly that - it is a movie that is almost strictly made for existing fans to a fault at times. As a superfan of the original Sopranos series, this movie was a really fun watch for me. It expanded the Sopranos 'universe' enough to show us a bit more about how the characters became who they were in the show. There was a lot of subtle fan=servicing throughout as well - fun and subtle callbacks (callforwards?), retelling of some stories that were maybe glossed over or briefly mentioned in the show, and even reimagining of some scenes from the show as well. Unfortunately, this movie cannot stand on its own. It is also not worthy of being added to the mob movie genre half of fame, although, I can see that possibly changing with time, as with a lot of polarizing media. Overall, I'd give it a light 7/10.
